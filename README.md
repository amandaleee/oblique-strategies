# oblique-strategies
Oblique strategies app written in jquery about 4 years ago. Going to clean it up.

TODO: 
- what am i even doing w that stylesheet, indenting, wtf
- probably just don't use jquery lol 
- how about i DON'T render 102034809 DOM elements that are display:none
- responsiveness
- "tweet this" 
- i don't know if these are actually all oblique strategies. i recognize ~3 that are kerouac, let's get rid of them. 
- make this readme an actual, legitimately helpful document
